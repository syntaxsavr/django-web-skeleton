This file declares the contract `/create-skill diagnose animations` reads to parameterize the generic Diagnose Mode procedure for this skill.
The contract spec lives at [`skills/authoring/create-skill/rules/diagnostic-surface.md`](../../../authoring/create-skill/rules/diagnostic-surface.md).

## Phase model

`animations` is a 15-step workflow.
Steps walk in order; conditional entry phases (A, B) and sub-phases (5.5–5.8, 7.5–7.6) only fire when their trigger applies, but the diagnoser walks every row to attribute findings.

| Phase | Name                       | Rule file                                                                                                 | Gate                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 7.5   | Record evidence (optional) | [record-and-iterate.md](./record-and-iterate.md), [screen-recorder skill](../../../analysis/screen-recorder/SKILL.md) | For non-trivial animations or on user request: `Skill("screen-recorder")` invoked twice (default + `prefers-reduced-motion: true`); skipped silently if not installed                        |
| 7.6   | Analyse and iterate        | [record-and-iterate.md](./record-and-iterate.md), [video-analyser skill](../../../analysis/video-analyser/SKILL.md)   | Recordings fed into `Skill("video-analyser")`; contradicting findings loop back to 7.5 (cap 3 iterations, escalate via `confidence(analysis)` on the 4th); skipped silently if not installed |

The decision flow in [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md#decision-flow) is a cross-cutting routing gate — it precedes Phase 5 and decides which downstream sub-phase (5.5 / 5.6 / 5.7 / 5.8) fires.
The diagnoser treats a wrong tool choice (e.g. Motion for a CSS-only hover) as a Phase 5 finding, not a sub-phase finding.

The taxonomy is **append-only** and intentionally seeded with `F-novel` only.
Speculative categories were not pre-populated — they push the diagnoser toward forcing a match where none exists.
Real-world failure classes (e.g. "layout property animated via shorthand", "`@property` snap", "`framer-motion` import regression", "missing `prefers-reduced-motion` branch", "wrong tool from decision flow") will be added as confidence-gated, user-approved diagnoses produce them.

## Hard invariants

The diagnoser must not propose to relax any of these without explicit user confirmation:

- **Composite-only animation.** Only `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, or a `@property`-registered custom property that drives one of those, may be animated on the hot path. Anything else requires a layout-thrash measurement that justifies the cost.
- **`will-change` is a scalpel.** Applied just before the animation and removed right after; never on idle elements; never on more than a handful of nodes at once.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` is non-removable.** Every shipped animation has a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` branch. The reduced branch may fade or snap, but it never strips feedback entirely.
- **Decision flow is authoritative.** The 12-row table in [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md#decision-flow) is walked top-to-bottom, first match wins; on ties the lower-numbered row wins. Diagnoses may not propose to skip the flow.
- **GSAP and `framer-motion` are out.** GSAP is excluded from the decision flow on purpose (Motion's hybrid engine subsumes it at smaller bundle size). `framer-motion` is unmaintained — new code uses `motion` (`motion/react`). Diagnoses may not re-introduce either.
- **State-choreography planning checklist is mandatory.** Phase 5.5 never runs without first walking the pre-code checklist in [`state-choreography.md`](./state-choreography.md). Skipping it is the most common cause of `layoutId` mismatches.
- **Layout properties are never animated directly during a state morph.** Phase 5.5 routes through Motion `layout` / `layoutId` or View Transitions; direct animation of `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` is refused.
- **External-engine runtimes are lazy-loaded and pausable.** Lottie / dotLottie and Rive runtimes never load on first paint and never run off-screen. Diagnoses may not propose eager loading "for simplicity."
- **Phase 7 measurement is real.** Performance is verified in DevTools (or equivalent), not by inspection. "Felt smooth" is not a pass condition.
- **`screen-recorder` and `video-analyser` companions degrade silently.** Phases 7.5 and 7.6 skip if the companions are not installed; they never block. The two-recording handshake (default + `prefers-reduced-motion: true`) is mandatory when 7.5 fires.
- **Phase 7.6 iteration cap is load-bearing.** The record → analyse → fix loop is capped at 3 iterations; the 4th must escalate via `Skill("confidence", "analysis")`. Raising the cap requires updating [`record-and-iterate.md`](./record-and-iterate.md) and this surface in the same change.

| `.agent/recordings/{output-name}.{webm,mp4,gif}` (default branch)     | `screen-recorder` companion | Phase 7.5 (first call: `reduced-motion: false`)                                   |
| `.agent/recordings/{output-name}--reduced-motion.{webm,mp4,gif}`      | `screen-recorder` companion | Phase 7.5 (second call: `reduced-motion: true`)                                   |
| Structured analyser findings (errors, key-frame UI state, next steps) | `video-analyser` companion  | Phase 7.6 (consumed in-loop; persisted only if the analyser writes a report file) |
| `confidence(analysis)` evaluation                                     | `confidence` skill          | Phase 7.6 4th-iteration escalation only                                           |

The skill produces no orchestration artifact of its own (no `plan.md`, no ledger).
Diagnoses against animations runs rely primarily on the **source diff** plus any recordings produced by Phase 7.5.
A run that skipped Phase 7.5 has a thinner evidence trail and the report should call that out as a contributing factor.

## Validators

- `claude plugin validate skills/design/animations` — frontmatter + structure check.
- Re-run the failing scenario in DevTools Performance on the diagnosed branch — confirms the proposed change still hits 60 fps with no purple Layout / green Paint bars.
- Toggle `prefers-reduced-motion` in DevTools Rendering and re-verify — confirms the reduced branch still exists and still produces visible (but reduced) feedback.
- If Phase 7.5 was in scope, re-run `Skill("screen-recorder")` with the same `output-name` and diff the recording against the pre-diagnosis artifact — confirms the change did not introduce regressions in adjacent frames.
